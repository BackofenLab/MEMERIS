                           Introduction             
=============================================================================
The  MEME system provides online tools for discovering  and using protein and 
DNA sequence motifs.  A motif is a pattern of nucleotides or amino acids that 
appears repeatedly in a group of related  DNA or protein sequences.  The MEME 
system represents motifs as position-dependent scoring matrices. 

The MEME system consists of two programs which allow you to: 
  meme - for discovery of motifs shared by a group of sequences and, 
  mast - for search of databases for sequences containing these motifs. 

You can download the ANSI C source code for MEME system from
http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/website/meme-download.html

You can also use the MEME system via its website at http://meme.nbcr.net

                          Prerequisite Software        
=============================================================================
Most of the software mentioned here is standrard on many UNIX systems.
To build MEME/MAST you will need:

   1  Perl (v.5.6.1 or higher) is needed to run some scripts. 
      See http://www.perl.org for download and installation instructions.
   2. The GNU Autoconf (version 2.53 or later)
   3. The GNU Automake (version 1.6 or later)
   4. Make
   5. A C compiler
   5. Gzip/gunzip 

Optional software:

   1. The CGI.pm perl module is needed if the web site is to be installed, 
   2. A linux cluster running  Rocks (see http://www.rocksclusters.org) or
      similar cluster environment.  Rocks provides all the required and 
      optional software.
   3. MPI implementation is needed to run parallel version of MEME. One of 
      the following: 
                     LAM (http://www.lam-mpi.org) 
                     MPICH (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich).
   4. Batch  scheduler is needed to run parallel  verison of MEME.  One of
      the following:        
                     SGE (http://gridengine.sunsource.net) 
                     PBS (http://www.openpbs.org)


=============================================================================
                      Operating System Requirements
=============================================================================
The MEME system has been tested with the following UNIX operating systems:

    Redhat Enterprise Linux
    SunOS 5.9
    
System requirements:
    Memory     10 Mb
    Disk      100 Mb
    Database  ~26 Gb  (needed if installing servers)


=============================================================================
                          Installation         
=============================================================================
See INSTALL file for installation instructions.


=============================================================================
                          Documentation 
=============================================================================
Documentation is available online at http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/website/meme
If you did installation with the --enable-web switch, the html documentation
will be installed in <install-path>/web/ directory. 


=============================================================================
                        Using MEME/MAST
=============================================================================
Before using MEME and mast, users must add a few environment variables.
All needed variables are defined in meme.csh and meme.sh files.

(1) if using csh and tcsh, execute the following command:
    source $prefix/etc/meme.csh   

To make the addition of these variabls automatic add a line to your .cshrc 
or .tcshrc file:
    source $prefix/etc/meme.csh     

(2) if using sh or bash, execute the following command:
    . $prefix/etc/meme.sh 

To make the addition of these variabls automatic add a line to your .profile 
or .bash_profile file:
    . $prefix/etc/meme.sh   

The $prefix should be a full path to the installation directory.
To find out how to use MEME or MAST execute
    meme
    mast

Both scripts print usage on stdout.

                          Developers Notes
=============================================================================
Check out from cvs ( you have to have read/write access to this cvs)
cvs -d cvs.rocksclusters.org:/home/cvs/CVSROOT co nbcr/apps/meme-rocks.

to create a distribution tar ball meme_VERSION.tar.gz
    cd nbcr/apps/meme-rocks
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make dist

Whenever databases are added to MAST:
	1) add the database to website/mast.html
	2) add the database to website/mast-databases.html
	3) add the database to etc/mast_db.list or etc/mast_upstream_db.list
