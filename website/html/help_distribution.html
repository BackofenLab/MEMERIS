<TITLE> MEME - Motif Distribution </TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="images/bkg.jpg">

<HR>
MEME searches for similarities among the sequences you give it.
How those similarities (motifs) may be shared is determined by
the <b>motif distribution menu</b>.  
<ol>
<li>One per sequence
<li>Zero or one per sequence
<li>Any number of repetitions
</ol>

If you choose the first option,
MEME assumes that each sequence in the
dataset contains <B>exactly</B> one occurrence
of each motif.  This option is the <I>fastest</I> and most <I>sensitive</I> 
but the motifs returned by MEME may be "blurry" if any of the sequences 
is missing them.

<P>
If you choose the second option,
MEME assumes that each sequence may contain <B>at most</B> one
occurrence of each motif.  This option is useful when you suspect that
some motifs may be missing from some of the sequences.
In that case, the motifs found will be more accurate than using the 
first option.  This option takes more computer time than the
first option (about twice as much) and is slightly less sensitive to 
weak motifs present in all of the sequences.

<P>
If you choose the third option,
MEME assumes each sequence may contain <B>any number</B> of
non-overlapping occurrences of each motif.  
This option is useful when you suspect that motifs repeat multiple
times within a single sequence.  In that case, the motifs found 
will be much more accurate than using one of the other options.
This option can also be used to discover repeats within
a single sequence.  
This option takes the much more computer time than the first option
(about ten times as much) and is somewhat less sensitive to weak motifs which
do not repeat within a single sequence than the other two options.
