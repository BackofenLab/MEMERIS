<BODY BACKGROUND="images/bkg.jpg">

<HR>
The preferred sequence format for MEME is Pearson/Fasta format.  
For example,
<UL>
                        ><B>ICYA_MANSE</B> INSECTICYANIN A FORM 
			(BLUE BILIPROTEIN) <BR>
                        GDIFYPGYCPDVKPVNDFDLSAFAGAWHEIAK <BR>
                        LPLENENQGKCTIAEYKYDGKKASVYNSFVSNGVKEYMEGDLEIAPDA <BR>
                        ><B>LACB_BOVIN</B> BETA-LACTOGLOBULIN PRECURSOR 
			(BETA-LG) <BR>
                        MKCLLLALALTCGAQALIVTQTMKGLDI <BR>
                        QKVAGTWYSLAMAASDISLLDAQSAPLRVYVEELKPTPEGDLEILLQKW <BR>
</UL>
                        Sequences start with a header line followed by
                        sequence lines.  A header line has
                        the character ``>'' in position one, followed by
                        an unique name without any spaces, followed by 
			(optional) descriptive text.  After the header line come
                        the actual sequence lines.  Spaces and blank lines are
                        ignored.  Sequences may be in capital or lowercase or
                        both.
<P> 
                        MEME uses the first word in the header line of each
                        sequence, truncated to 24 characters if necessary,
                        as the name of the sequence. This name must be unique.
                        Sequences with duplicate names will be ignored. 
                        (The first word in the title line is
                        everything following the ">" up to the first blank.)
<P> 
                        Sequence weights may be specified in the dataset
                        file by special header lines where the unique name
                        is ``WEIGHTS'' (all caps) and the discriptive
                        text is a list of sequence weights.
                        Sequence weights are numbers in the range 0 < w <=1.
                        All weights are assigned in order to the
                        sequences in the file. If there are more sequences
                        than weights, the remainder are given weight one.
                        Weights must be greater than zero and less than
                        or equal to one.  Weights may be specified by
                        more than one "WEIGHT" entry which may appear
                        anywhere in the file, but you must not put weights
                        on lines that don't start with ">WEIGHT".  
			When weights are used,
                        sequences will contribute to motifs in proportion
                        to their weights.  Here is an example for a file
                        of three sequences where the first two sequences are
                        very similar and it is desired to down-weight them:
<UL> 
                        >WEIGHTS 0.5 .5 <BR>
                        >WEIGHTS 1.0 <BR>
                        >seq1 <BR>
                        GDIFYPGYCPDVKPVNDFDLSAFAGAWHEIAK <BR>
                        >seq2 <BR>
                        GDMFCPGYCPDVKPVGDFDLSAFAGAWHELAK <BR>
                        >seq3 <BR>
                        QKVAGTWYSLAMAASDISLLDAQSAPLRVYVEELKPTPEGDLEILLQKW <BR>
</UL>
The web version of MEME also accepts protein and DNA sequences in any of the 
following formats by converting them to Pearson/Fasta format.  When using
these formats, it is not possible to specify sequence weights.
<UL>
<B>Sequence formats that allow one or more sequences:</B>
<P>
<LI>	 IG/Stanford, used by Intelligenetics and others
<LI>	 GenBank/GB, genbank flatfile format
<LI>	 NBRF format
<LI>	 EMBL, EMBL flatfile format
<LI>	 DNAStrider, for common Mac program
<LI>	 Fitch format, limited use
<LI>	 Pearson/Fasta, a common format used by Fasta programs and others
<LI>	 Zuker format, limited use
<LI>	 Olsen, format printed by Olsen VMS sequence editor
<LI>	 Phylip3.2, sequential format for Phylip programs
<LI>	 Phylip, interleaved format for Phylip programs (v3.3, v3.4)
<LI>	 MSF multi sequence format used by GCG software
<LI>	 PAUP's multiple sequence (NEXUS) format
<LI>	 PIR/CODATA format used by PIR

<P>

<B>Sequence formats that only allow one sequence. These formats cannot
be used to input multiple sequences.</B>
<P>

<LI>	 Plain/Raw, sequence data only (no name, document, numbering)
</UL>

MEME uses the

ReadSeq</A> program to read in sequences. ReadSeq is copyright 1990 by
