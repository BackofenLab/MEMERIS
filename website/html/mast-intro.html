<H3> Introduction </H3>

<H4>
	MAST is a tool for searching biological sequence databases for 
	sequences that contain one or more of a group of known motifs.  

<P>
	A motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of 
	related protein or DNA sequences. Motifs are represented as 
	position-dependent scoring matrices that describe the 
	score of each possible letter at each position in the pattern. 
	Individual motifs may not contain gaps. Patterns with variable-length 
	gaps must be split into two or more separate motifs before being
	submitted as input to MAST.

<P>
	MAST takes as 
	<A HREF="mast-input.html">input</A> 
	a file containing the descriptions of one or more motifs
 	and searches a sequence database that you select for sequences 
	that match the motifs.  The motif file can be the output of the
	<A HREF=meme-intro.html>MEME</A> motif discovery tool 
	or any file in the appropriate format.

<P>
	MAST <A HREF="mast-output.html">outputs</A> three things:

<OL>
<LI>	The names of the 
        <A HREF="mast-output.html#names">high-scoring sequences</A>
        sorted by the strength of the combined match of the sequence to all of 
	the motifs in the group.
<LI>	<A HREF="mast-output.html#diagrams">Motif diagrams</A>
	showing the order and spacing of the motifs within each matching 
	sequence. 
<LI>	<A HREF="mast-output.html#annotation">Detailed annotation</A>
	of each matching sequence showing the sequence and the locations 
	and strengths of matches to the motifs.
</OL>

<P>
	MAST works by calculating 
	<A HREF="mast-output.html#score">match scores</A> for each
	sequence in the database compared with each of the motifs in the
	group of motifs you provide.  
	For each sequence, the match scores are converted
	into various types of <A HREF="mast-output.html#pvalues">p-values</A> 
	and these
	are used to determine the overall match of the sequence to the
	group of motifs and the probable order and spacing of occurrences of
	the motifs in the sequence.
