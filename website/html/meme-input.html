<HR> 
<P> 
<B>The input to MEME contains the following fields.</B> 
<UL> 
<A NAME="email"> 
<LI>	<B>e-mail address</B> 
	<BR> 
	This is the address where the confirmation message and motifs will be 
	sent.  Make sure this is a valid e-mail address.  

<A NAME="description"> 
<LI>	<B>description</B>[optional] 
	<BR> 
	This will be included in the subject lines of the messages MEME will 
	send you.  
	You may only use the following characters in your description:
<UL>
		<B>a-zA-Z0-9:;-_"()<>%</B>
</UL>
	All other characters will be converted to blanks.
	This field is optional so you may leave it blank if you wish.

<A NAME="sequences">
<LI>	<B>sequences</B>
	<BR> 
	This is the group of sequences (the "training set")
	which you want MEME to analyze for
	patterns that are shared among the sequences and/or repeat within
	individual sequences.  All of the sequences must be either protein
	or DNA.  You may not mix different types of sequences in the same group.
	MEME supports a large number of sequence
	<A HREF="help_format.html"><B>formats</B></A>.  The Web version
	of MEME requires that the sequences in your group have fewer than 60,000
	<A HREF="help_alphabet.html"><B>characters</B></A> in total. 
	To specify the sequences you wish MEME to analyze, 
	you can enter either a file name or the actual sequences.  Do not
	enter both.

	<UL>

	<A NAME="filename">
	<LI> <B>file name</B>
	This should be the name of a file on your computer containing
	a group of related sequences in an appropriate sequence
        <A HREF="help_format.html"><B>format</B></A>.

	<A NAME="actual-sequences">
	<LI> <B>actual sequences</B>
	You may type or cut-and-paste the sequences in an appropriate
	sequence <A HREF="help_format.html"><B>format</B></A>
	in the window provided here.

	</UL>

<A NAME="distribution">
<LI>	<B>motif distribution</B>
	<BR>
	This is where you tell MEME how you believe occurrences of the
	motifs are 
  	<A HREF ="help_distribution.html"><B>distributed</B></A>
	among the sequences.  Selecting the correct type of distribution
	improves the sensitivity and quality of the motif search.

<A NAME="nmotifs">
<LI>	<B>number of motifs</B>
	<BR>
	MEME will look for up to this number of distinct motifs in the
	training set.  MEME will stop when this number of motifs has been
	found, or when none can be found with <I>E</I>-value less than 10000.

<A NAME="nsites">
<LI>	<B>number of sites</B>[optional]
	<BR>
	This is the total number of sites in the <I>training set</I>
	where a single motif occurs.
	You can choose different limits for 
	the <B>minimum</B> and <B>maximum</B> number of occurrences that 
	MEME will consider.  If you have prior knowledge about the number
	of occurrences that motifs have in your trainig set, limiting
	MEME's search in this way can can increase the likelihood of MEME
	finding true motifs.  
	<BR>
	For example, if you know that each motif is 
	likely to occur at least 5 times but no more than 8 times in the
	training set, you could specify:
	<UL>
	<B>Minimum</B> sites =  5
	<BR>
	<B>Maximum</B> sites</B> = 8
	</UL>
	MEME will then only report motifs with between 5 and 8 occurrences,
	inclusive, in the training set.  (The same range [5,...,8] 
	will apply, separately, to each motif MEME finds.) 
	MEME may still find motifs with slightly fewer or more occurrences
	then those you specify.
	In the above example, if there is a motif in the training set 
	with only 4 occurrences, MEME may still find it, but it will 
	report 5 occurrences, one of which will be erroneous.  
	Likewise, if a 
	motif in the training set has 9 occurrences, MEME will probably 
	still find it, but it will report only 8 of its occurrences.
	<BR>
	MEME chooses the number of occurrences to report for each motif
	by optimizing a statistical heuristic function, restricting the
	number of occurrences to the range you give here, or using 
	defaults described below if you leave these fields blank.
	<BR>
	<B>Note 1:</B> 
	<BR>Leave these fields blank if you have selected
	"<B>One</B> per sequence" in the 
	"How you think the occurrences...  are <B>distributed</B>" field.  
	In that case, each sequence must have exactly one occurrence of
	each motif.  It also doesn't make any sense to 
	set the maximum number of sites to a number larger than the 
	number of sequences if you have chosen the "<B>Zero or one</B> per
	sequence distribution.  In that case, there can never be more
	occurrences of a motif than there are sequences.
	<BR>
	<B>Note 2:</B> 
	<BR>These fields are optional.  If you leave them blank,
	MEME will choose limits depending on the type of occurrence 
	distribution you have specified and the number of sequences 
	(<I>n</I>)
	in the training set.  
	MEME will also override your settings if
	they conflict with the type of distribution you have chosen (see
	<B>Note 1</B>, above).

	<TABLE BORDER>
	  <TR> <TH COLSPAN=3> Default Numbers of Sites for each Motif
	  <TR>
	    <TH> type of distribution
	    <TH> minimum sites
	    <TH> maximum sites
	  <TR>
	    <TD> <B>one</B> occurrence per sequence
	    <TD> <I>n</I>
	    <TD> <I>n</I>
	  <TR>
	    <TD> <B>zero or one</B> occurrence per sequence
	    <TD> sqrt(<I>n</I>)
	    <TD> <I>n</I>
	  <TR>
	    <TD> <B>any number</B> of repetitions per sequence
	    <TD> sqrt(<I>n</I>)
	    <TD> min(5*<I>n</I>, 50)
	</TABLE>
 
<A NAME="width">
<LI>	<B>motif width</B>
	<BR>
	This is the width (number of characters in the sequence
	pattern) of a single motif. MEME chooses the optimal
	width of each motif individually using a statistical heuristic function.
	You can choose different limits for the <B>minimum</B> 
	and <B>maximum</B> motif widths that MEME will consider.  
	The width of each motif that MEME reports will lie within the limits
	you choose.
 
<A NAME="text">
<LI>    <B>text output format</B>
        <BR>
        Choosing this option will cause MEME to produce plain text (ASCII)
        output.  By default, MEME output is in hypertext (HTML) format.

<A NAME="shuffle">
<LI>    <B>shuffle letters in input sequences</B>
        <BR>
        You can ask MEME to shuffle the letters in each of your input
        sequences.  This can be useful for determining if the motifs
        found by MEME using your (unshuffled) sequences are not
        statistically significant.  To determine this, compare the MAST output
        you received from MEME for your original sequences with that received
        using the "Shuffle letters in input sequences" option.  (Keep all other
        MEME parameter settings the same so that the comparison will be valid.)
        Compare the best p-values for the first motif in the original
        run to the best p-values for the first motif in the shuffled run.
        If they are similar (or the p-values in the shuffled run tend to
        be smaller), then the motif is probably not significant.
        Repeat this process for each motif bearing in mind that the earlier
        motifs are most likely to be significant.
        Concluding that a motif is significant is more problematic.
        Low p-value occurrences of the motif in many sequences and in
        a conserved position relative to other motifs (or the ends of the
        sequence) is evidence that it is statistically significant.
        You can use the shuffle option to help determine what "low" is for the
        particular set of sequences and MEME parameters you are using.

<A NAME="posonly">
<LI>    <B>search given strand only</B>
        <BR>
	MEME searches for motifs on both the given DNA strand <B>and</B>
	the reverse complement strand by default.  Checking this box
	will cause MEME to search the given DNA strand only.

<A NAME="pal">
<LI>    <B>look for palindromes only</B>
        <BR>
	Checking this box causes MEME to search only for DNA palindromes.
        This causes MEME to average the letter frequencies in corresponding 
        motif columns together. For instance, if the width of the 
        motif is 10, columns 1 and 10, 2 and 9, 3 and 8, etc., 
        are averaged together.  The averaging combines the 
        frequency of A in one column with T in the other, 
        and the frequency of C in one column with G in the other.  
	If this box is <B>not</B> checked, the columns are <B>not</B> averaged
	together. 


<P>
	Clicking on the <B>Start search</B> button causes your sequences to 
	be sent to
	<A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/">San Diego Supercomputer Center</A> 
	(SDSC) and analyzed by MEME for repeated patterns.
<P>
	The results of the MEME analysis are sent to you by e-mail.
<P>
	No copies of your sequences or analysis results are saved at SDSC after
	the results have been sent to you.
